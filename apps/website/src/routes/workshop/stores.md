# Stores & Context

## Managing State

State management is homogenous inside and outside of components. However, we still can use some help to best organize our code. This comes in two forms:

Stores - Deeply nested proxies with fine-grained subscriptions.
Context - Mechanism to inject state without passing props through.

## Updating TodoMVC

We will continue with our Todo MVC application to apply the new things we have learned.
